[LIVE TEST LINK](https://<your-github-ElishaParker>.github.io/eyewrite/)  

## Overview  
EyeWrite is a browser-based, hands-free writing, speaking and searching interface controlled by gaze, blinks and dwell. It is built for accessibility, creative flow and minimal UI.  
The user can write via on-screen keyboard triggered by gaze or blink, use text-to-speech to listen, search the web, and scroll/select text without hands.

## Features  
- Write in full-screen mode, use toolbar for fonts & formatting  
- On-screen keyboard auto opens via gaze/blink; two modes: Precision (double-blink or 1.5 s dwell) and QuickType (single blink or 0.7 s dwell)  
- Search integration: gaze/blink on üîç opens browser half screen with your query  
- Text-to-speech: gaze/blink on üîä reads your document aloud  
- Scroll bands (top & bottom) for vertical only scrolling  
- Triple-blink + gaze moves for text selection & pop-up menu: copy, copy+delete, delete  
- Cursor style menu (default, crosshair, text) via gaze  
- Instruction overlay on first use, closable and persistent  
- Local autosave of the text content in browser storage  
- All processing & data local; no analytics or external telemetry
